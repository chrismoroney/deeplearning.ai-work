    "To determine our model's performance, we need to be able to calculate several different **metrics**. Metrics are measurements that can be used to analyze the performance and effectiveness of a model's function, such as binary classification (or classification of data between two classes). In this lab, we will learn about this model's purpose which are to determine if a patient has a disease, COVID-19, given two inputs of data. We will also discuss *how* the model classifies patients as healthy or sick. This is a process known as binary classification, and the model goes through training with an activation function in order to produce an answer. Finally, we will calculate the metrics of our model's performance to determine how well our model performed. Besides accuracy, there are many metrics that are extremely important to consider, such as Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV. We will also understand what a confusion matrix is and analyze the results that a confusion matrix produces. By the end of this lab, you will be able to determine a binary classifier's performance based off of calculated metrics. Based on these metrics, you may come up with techniques to improve your model's performance, or perhaps even lower the training to prevent overfitting in your model. "
